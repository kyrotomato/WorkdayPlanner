# Workday Planner
## Description
This is a simple workday planner to help you plan out your 9 - 5.
It's developed in the javascript language using Jquery and multiple other CDNs.
Based on the time of day, tasks are either grey for past, red for present, or green for in the future.
Tasks pertain on refresh via local storage

## Issues 
Using Id selectors to load the localStorage info doesn't work properly. Opted for class selectors instead

## Future Additions
24 hour coverage, as well as server storage for tasks
